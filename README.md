## rqt plugin wizard for QtCreator

Now it is easy.

Clone this repo to <QtCreator's install path>/share/qtcreator/templates/wizards/projects/rqt_plugin

And then:

### rqt plugin building tips for QtCreator

- Start the QtCreator from a shell where the catkin env is setup properly (setup.sh is sourced)
- Create the project with the wizard
- Remove the make step add a custom build step to call catkin_make (similar to this one):

To the run configuration add  the following:

With this setup you can even debug your plugin with GDB.
